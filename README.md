`@glare-labs/vue-mdc` provides easy-to-use simple Vue components, provides complete type support, and is based on Vue3, Sass and TypeScript.

With the help of the third-party library [`@material/material-color-utilities`](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities), you can easily create a color scheme that conforms to the rules, and each component following the design principles of [`Material Design 3`](https://m3.material.io/).

> For more information on color generation, please go to [@material/material-color-utilities](https://github.com/material-foundation/material-color-utilities).

> For more information about MD, please go to [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/).

_Vue-MDC is developed for Vite. If you are using Webpack or other scaffolding, Vue-MDC cannot ensure that it will run as expected._
